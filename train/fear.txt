i always feel a little bit hesitant on giving much general advice
i want to avoid feeling alarmed
ill try to make that time to feel as i did in the past few days where there arent really those responsibilities or where i embrace the neurotic feeling although its somewhat true that i am needed because no one else can do what i do so i just pile up stress
i remember feeling nervous of whether my friends would like it or not
i feel uncomfortable and helpless in my own personal space its time to react
i feel not only personally threatened but also am very scared of losing my job
i feel like she wants me to kiss her even though she just told me in no uncertain terms that shes a lesbian
i feel like we re about to break up and i m terrified
i feel wimpy but i feel less nervous
i completely understand why you feel so distressed and embittered but let s try and look at this in another way
i am feeling very apprehensive about the future at the moment
