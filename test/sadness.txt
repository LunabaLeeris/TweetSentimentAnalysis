i feel extremely alone and isolated but the thing is is that nothing could be further from the truth
i feel that way and sometimes i think its all in vain
i still remember that day when i came inside the class feeling awfully awkward
i end up feeling bad about myself and or others
i used to feel embarrassed to tell my story because i blamed myself for putting my children through such a difficult ordeal
